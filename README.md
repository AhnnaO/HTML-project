# HTML-project
My first HTML & CSS assignment. September 2018

This is my first project in HTML and CSS. The class assignment was to create a fully responsive webpage using HTML, CSS and SASS.
For this project we were given a company name, "Elexir" which is a fictional juice bar, some page and content requirements, automation
requirements and three bold colors that must be used throughout the site. It was also to have current web accessibility, be a live working site
and have been tested on several browsers.
